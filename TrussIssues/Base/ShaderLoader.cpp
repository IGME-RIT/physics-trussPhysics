*	Use Base and PhysicsTimestep as the base code for this project.
*	Changed Base so that a lot of the OpenGL code is inside the Mesh class.
*	This is so that it isn't in the way to understanding the point of this tutorial.
* Description:
*	This is a trial of deformable bodies by treating the game objects as Trusses in a statically determinate method of joints problem.
*
*	A simple program with a static triangle that falls on a Warren Bridge Truss. (Might also try a Pratt or Howe Truss)
*	This will be using a simple Planar Truss. Only do work on the joints.
*	Next step is to treat 3D objects as a combination of Space Frame Trusses.
*		Each 3D object will be composed of 3D tetrahedrons with the triangles being the base and the position being the tip.
*			Might not even be necessary, since it deals with working on the joints and treating the problem as statically determinate.

	// This location is stored as a streampos member type, and the parameters passed in must be of this type as well
	// seekg parameters are (offset, direction) or you can just use an absolute (position).
	// The offset parameter is of the type streamoff, and the direction is of the type seekdir (an enum which can be ios::beg, ios::cur, or ios::end referring to the beginning,
